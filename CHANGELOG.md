# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Version numbering follows hardware revision conventions: `rev-X.Y` where X is the
major revision (significant redesign) and Y is the minor revision (incremental
change within the same design generation).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- V1 goals section for next major hardware revision planning
- Imported hardware design and fabrication artifacts from `Inbox/` into
  repository hardware paths:
  - `hardware/schematic/SPARK Schematic.fsch`
  - `hardware/pcb/SPARK PCB.fbrd`
  - `hardware/pcb/Electronics Design.f3z`
  - `hardware/fabrication/SPARK PCB.zip`
  - `hardware/fabrication/SPARK PCB.tar`
  - `hardware/fabrication/SPARK PCB.tgz`
  - `hardware/outputs/odb++/ODBFiles/`
- Board render images:
  - `images/spark-board-top.png`
  - `images/spark-board-perspective.png`
- `validation/bring_up.md` — first-article bring-up procedure and V0.4
  known-limits list
- `validation/results/TEMPLATE.md` — session record template
- `hardware/README.md` — source/generated-output map and CERN-OHL-S-2.0 notice
  for the manufacturing package (ODB++-only status documented)
- `SECURITY.md` — design-fault / hazard / licensing reporting path
- `.github/workflows/integrity.yml` — repository-integrity CI (links, Markdown,
  expected artifacts, BOM syntax, cross-document consistency); no EDA tools
- SPDX (`CERN-OHL-S-2.0`) notices added to project documents

### Changed

- README top reworked: purpose, current version, "Prototype / beta hardware in
  bring-up" status, key architecture, critical VTREF/power warnings, direct
  links, and a per-stage status table (designed → field-validated)
- README license section now names CERN-OHL-S-2.0 explicitly, with SPDX and
  Source Location
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten to match the actual toolchain (Autodesk Fusion
  Electronics, single maintainer) instead of the scaffolded KiCad workflow;
  added first-release criteria
- Documentation aligned to V0.4 architecture baseline
- Local intake workflow formalized: `Inbox/` is git-ignored and used only for
  non-versioned handoff files

### Fixed

- N/A

### V1 Goals

- Add VTREF overvoltage protection/disconnect path
- Evaluate optional split CAN termination network (60 Ω + 60 Ω + capacitor)

---

## [rev-0.4] - Architecture Update (In Progress)

### Added

- 5 V entry protection architecture based on TPS2596 eFuse (`5V_OUT` -> eFuse ->
  SPARK master 5 V)
- Target rail gating for `1.8V_TARGET`, `3.3V_TARGET`, and `5V_TARGET` using
  TPS22919 load switches with hardware default-OFF EN pulldowns
- Dedicated low-noise LDO rails for internal 1.8 V and 3.3 V logic domains
- Hybrid translation architecture:
  - LSF0108 for open-drain/complex signals (I2C minimum)
  - SN74AXC8T245 for push-pull/high-bandwidth signals (SPI, UART, GPIO, SWO as
    applicable)
- Per-line 22 Ω series resistors on external-facing signal lines
- SP0503BAHTG ESD arrays on external interfaces with clamp reference to GND
- CAN FD physical layer with TCAN1051 and switchable 120 Ω termination
- PCB/mechanical baseline notes: 4-layer controlled-impedance stackup
  (JLC04161H-7628), heavy GND flooding with via stitching, 12 mil typical
  routing, ENIG finish, ink-plugged vias, 88.9 mm x 88.9 mm board envelope

### Changed

- VTREF policy documentation made explicit: VTREF/logic-domain constraints are
  separate from target power export
- VTREF operating guidance set conservatively to `<= 3.6 V` unless explicit
  hardware OVP/disconnect is implemented
- Clarified that `5V_TARGET` is power-only and does not imply 5 V logic tolerance
  on interface pins
- Corrected SWDIO translator mapping to SN74AXC8T245

### Notes

- CAN TVS selection requirement documented as automotive-rated (part selection
  remains implementation-dependent)

---

## [rev-0.1] - Schematic Phase (In Progress)

### Added

- Project requirements definition
- Block diagram (see `docs/`)
- Initial component selection for protection, level translation, and power
  management functions
- Power architecture decision: separate VDD\_DBG and VDD\_TGT rails with
  independent control
- VTREF sensing and level translator enable logic defined
- Interface list confirmed: SWD, JTAG (10-pin and 20-pin), UART, SPI, I2C, CAN

### Changed

- N/A (initial revision)
